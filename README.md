# cadelwatson.com

This is the source code for my [website](https://www.cadelwatson.com), built
using my [Neapolitan](https://kdelwat.github.io/Neapolitan/) CSS framework and
[Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io).

## Building

The site is composed of hand-written HTML, following the idea of [Brutalist
Websites](http://brutalistwebsites.com/). The only compilation step needed is
to convert the Sass stylesheet into CSS:

```bash
sass main.scss main.css
```

## Licensing

The site uses icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) by Dave Gandy,
generated using [Fontello](http://fontello.com/).
