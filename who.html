            <h1>Who?</h1>
            <p>I'm a bioinformatics student at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, who is passionate about solving problems with technology. <a href="why.html">More about my motivations.</a></p>
            <p>I build projects with a wide variety of technologies. I have expertise with the Python language and am competent with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. My work has included the use of modern and highly-used frameworks, including React, Vue, Flask, and Django. Whenever possible I experiment with unfamiliar technologies, like functional programming with Clojure and Haskell. <a href="what.html">More about my projects.</a></p>
