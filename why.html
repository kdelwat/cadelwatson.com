            <h1>Why?</h1>
            <p>The world is changing. Climate change, automation, and global inequality loom as existential threats to the human race, while political solutions appear further away than ever before.</p>
            <p>As a developer, I believe that I have a responsibility to harness technology to combat these large-scale problems. I study bioinformatics with the hope of applying my knowledge to the genetic modification of agricultural products, in order to feed the world's exponentially-growing population in the uncertain climate of the future.</p>
            <p>Our everyday standard of living is greater than it has ever been before, but there is always room for improvement. From designing the user interfaces of the future to creating applications for little-served niches, I aim to continually iterate and improve the lives of people around the globe.</p>
